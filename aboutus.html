                        We are 9876 "The Countdown" from Capital high school. Our Team consists of 7 members all of which are past FTC and FRC veterans. The Countdown is diving into its 9th season of FTC and making a splash. We are commited to FIRST and our community, from the Egypt hackathon last summer to middle school demenstrations in Olympia. Along with our outreach we host competitions every year and cover for when other schools aren't available, for example last year we hosted 3 competitions 2 Qualification competitions as well at the WATT Interleague in which 9876 took first place alongside our sister team 20118 that we mentored.
