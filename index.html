                    We are 9876 The Countdown from Capital High School. Our team consists of 7 team members. All of our team members are past FTC veterans and three of them are FRC veterans and current members.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                    Our mission is to promote STEAM in our community and to help future and current generations participate in <i>FIRSTÂ®</i> programs. We are currently mentoring two other FTC teams, 13484 and 20118; both of which are composed of rookie members. However, we are currently in the process of merging 20118 with our team.  In addition to this, we mentor five Intro to Robotics teams that use the REV starter kit. We use our experience of up to three years of both FTC and FRC to further their success in STEAM. We have taken this further by mentoring three FLL teams 5003, 5004, and 11388.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                    We also support teams in our community every time we host at Capital High School for the Washington Lovelace Interleague competition. We set up the day before the event working after school to help make sure the event is ready for the next day of FTC action which includes setting up all the equipment that is needed for judging, competing, and for the team's pits.
