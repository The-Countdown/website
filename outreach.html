                        In collaboration with the FRC team 4450, we have packed and sent 5 REV Robotics kits and 16 EV3 kits to Cairo Egypt in a Freight Frenzy to further STEM programs in Cairo, Egypt. We have also been mentoring them over Zoom and helping 4450 get packed and ready to visit again to run a week-long STEM camp

                        Our community outreach takes flight with the Olympic Flight Museum where we have been volunteering for over 2 and a half years every other weekend. Also, in collaboration with FRC team 4450, we help run their annual Olympic Airshow, where we run a booth promoting STEAM programs and letting everybody become a driver of a real competition FTC robot. So if you plan on going to the Olympic Airshow make sure to say hello and learn more about STEAM and our contributions to the community!

                        We are mentoring three FLL teams 5003, 5004 and 11888. we started mentoring them in early October 2023  and we still mentor them to this day ensuring that FLL can continue. there funding and subsequently mentoring was cut this year at Jefferson Middle School so we collaborated with the FRC team 4450 mentored them right here at Capital High School.

                        We mentored two FTC teams 20118 and 13484 our sister teams at Capital High School. all the members on both teams were all rookies and this was their first time in a FTC season. we guided them both through their first year in FIRSTÂ® robotics. We charged Up their ability so they could make their Power Play and take Center Stage. we ended up going to the state championship with 20118 for the first time since 2017.

                        <h1>Theater</h1>
                        Our outreach truly takes center stage with our help in the Capital Theatre production She Kills Monsters. It started with three robots dubbed "wraiths" that would hang from the ceiling and fight the actors and just involved FTC. However we saw a great opportunity to expand to other levels of FIRST robotics so we invited FRC to make the "Beholder" a 6ftx6ft6xft monster and the three FLL teams we mentored 5003, 5004, and 11888 to make seven baby robots that would attack the actors. In total, 11 robots were made for the play.
